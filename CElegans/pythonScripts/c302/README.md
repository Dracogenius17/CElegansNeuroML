c302: simple NeuroML based network models of C elegans
------------------------------------------------------

This is an experimental set of files for generating network models in NeuroML 
based on C elegans connectivity data.

It used information on synaptic connectivity of the network and uses libNeuroML to generate 
a network in valid NeuroML, which can be run in jNeuroML.

There will be multiple version of the network, based on increasingly complex cell models, e.g.

A) Integrate & fire cells
B) Izhikevich cells
C) Single compartment, conductance based neurons

*Work in progress!!*
