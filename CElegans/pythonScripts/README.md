Some scripts to interact with, test and update the CElegans project

Prerequisites: 

- get pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)
- use pip to get libNeuroML (sudo pip install libNeuroML)
- use pip to get xlrd (sudo pip install xlrd)


Note: some of these scripts (e.g. CheckProject.py, GenerateNeuroML.py) require Jython, to interact with the Java code of [neuroConstruct](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuroConstruct). This comes bundled with neuroConstruct, e.g.

[nC.sh](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuroConstruct/blob/master/nC.sh) -python CheckProject.py
